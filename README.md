### Hi there 👋
I'm Álvaro from Spain. A psychologist with a passion for languages. When I realized that I could hold a conversation in Japanese, I knew it was time to learn how to talk
to computers. After living abroad in Norway and Romania, I felt in love with Python. I like its practicality and its ability to write readable, maintainable, and scalable code.
