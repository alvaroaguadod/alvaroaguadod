### Hi there 👋
I'm Álvaro from Spain. A psychologist with a passion for languages. When I realized that I could hold a conversation in Japanese, I knew it was time to learn how to talk
to computers. After living abroad in Norway and Romania, I felt in love with Python. I like its practicality and its ability to write readable, maintainable, and scalable code.

### 🌱 I’m currently:
  - Taking a Bootcamp on Backend with Python.
  - Studying in Depth Django and Flask.
  - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate with Startups, Developers and Companies on interesting projects where I can do my bit.

--> Feel free to get in touch :)
